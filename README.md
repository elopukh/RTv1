# RTv1
RTv1 is my first ray tracer coded in C, normed, humble but functionnal.
The goal is to implement the Ray-Tracing method to create a computer generated image.<br/>
• I have simple geometric objects as a base(sphere,cylinder etc.).<br/>
• Position and direction of any point of vision and of simple objects.<br/>
• Smallest light management : different brightness, shadows.<br/>
